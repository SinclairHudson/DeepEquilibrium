# DeepEquilibrium
Repo implementing Deep Equilibrium Models, based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01377


## TODO List:
- [ ] Trivial example working, in the forward pass (size 10)
- [ ] Trivial example working in the backwards pass (learn identity or constant)
- [ ] Use the approximate Jacobian and not the full jacobian
- [ ] More complicated 2D and 3D inputs and outputs
