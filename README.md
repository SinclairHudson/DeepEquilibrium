# DeepEquilibrium
Repo implementing Deep Equilibrium Models, based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01377


## TODO List:
- [x] Trivial example working, in the forward pass (size 10)
- [x] Trivial example working in the backwards pass (learn identity or constant)
- [ ] Get batching working (how does original repo do it?)
- [ ] MNIST
- [ ] Use the approximate Jacobian Inverse and not the full $$n \times n$$ matrix
- [ ] More complicated 2D and 3D inputs and outputs
